**I was just invited to the standup channel. What do I have to do?**  
Nothing! Your bot will message you in a private channel and ask you a few questions at check-in time.

**How do I find out when standup happens?**  
`...scheduled`

**What if I need to skip the standup today?**  
Just ignore the questions or reply `...stop`. Your bot will leave you out of the status report (although you might get called a slacker).

**How do I change my answers?**  
Type `...standup checkin`. You can change your answers as many times as necessary before the status report is sent.

**How do I add a new participant @some_new_user to the stand up?**  
In your standup channel, type `/invite @some_new_user`

**How do I remove myself from the standup?**   
Leave the standup channel. (In the standup channel, type `/leave`.)

**How do I see who has checked in so far today?**  
Type `...standup status`

**How do I change the setup?**  
Type `...setup standup`. You can run the setup as many time as you like.
