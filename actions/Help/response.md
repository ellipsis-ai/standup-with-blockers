Ellipsis runs standup meetings for your team by asking people questions and building a summary for the team to see.  

**Getting started**  
1. Install the Classic Standup Skill
1. Type `setup classic standup` in a message to Ellipsis. It will ask you a few questions.
1. You are done!

**Using it**  
Once setup is complete, every weekday at the check-in time, Ellipsis will privately message each member of the #standup channel (or whatever channel you chose during setup) and ask three questions:
1. What did you accomplish yesterday?
1. What are you planning to do today?
1. What is blocking you at the moment?

At publishing time (10:00 am in our example), Ellipsis will print a report with everyone's answers to the standup channel.
