The bot runs standup meetings for your team by asking people questions and building a summary for the team to see.  

**Getting started**  
To get started, type `setup standup` in a message to <@{ellipsis.teamInfo.botUserIdForContext}>. It will ask you a few questions to complete the setup process.

**Using it**  
Once setup is complete, every weekday at the check-in time, the bot will privately message each member of the standup channel and ask three questions:
1. What did you accomplish yesterday?
1. What are you planning to do today?
1. What is blocking you at the moment?

At the reporting time chosen during setup, the bot will print a report with everyone's answers to the standup channel.
